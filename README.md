## *Project Motivation*
This is a data analysis of AirBnB data for Munich. The main motivation for this project was to use this data to get some interessting insights into the AirBnB market in Munich. Especially to answer questions relevent for future visitors of Munich helping them to make the booking of their live. 
<br>
After first review of the data, following questions came into my mind which might be pretty usefull for future bookings:
- What is the most expensive and the cheapest time to visit Munich? 
- What is the best location to book if you want to save money but still get good quality?
- What type of property you should omit to not to pay too much?
- Is it possible to predict prices for properties in Munich?
